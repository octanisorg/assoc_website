title: Why giving matters
teaser: Octanis is an independent, non-profit association that relies on sponsorships, membership fees and private donations to buy materials, pay for travel and rent. We add value to students' theoretical education by encouraging them to pursue their moonshot goals and by teaching them a full project life cycle.

		<h1 id="seven_reasons">Seven reasons to support Octanis</h1>

		<ul type="i">
			<li>Octanis is building bridges: between disciplines, professional status and age groups. We encourage people from all kinds of backgrounds to talk and work together because we believe that this results in the greatest project outcomes.</li>
			<li>Our members learn a lot! From using a soldering iron or a 3D printer to how to deal with a customer. They get in touch with the real world and Octanis' <a href="https://poodle.octanis.org/">knowledge platform</a> gives them a big boost in doing so.</li>
			<li>Our members teach each other! They remember how hard it was to start and once they reach a certain level of experience they give back to the newer members.</li>
			<li>Octanis projects inspire others to do the same. Be it trough DNA workshops for promoting science to girls from 12 - 14 at <a href="http://www.elargisteshorizons.ch/">"Elargis tes Horizons"</a> or the example of a danish-french school where kids <a href="http://blog.ecolefrancodanoise.dk/droles-de-drones">replicated a small version of our rover</a>. </li>
			<li>Octanis is using, developing and promoting open-source hardware and software. Our more than 40 <a href="https://github.com/Octanis1/">GitHub</a> repositories contain tens of thousands of lines of code and hundreds of hardware design files. We document all our work on our <a href="https://wiki.octanis.org/">Wiki</a>. </li>
			<li>We challenge the status quo. We constantly question our own habits and do our projects in an unconventional manner! Because we have the freedom to fail, we can take higher risks and try cheaper materials, newer components and use them outside their intended scope, being a crucial recipe for innovation.</li>
			<li>We are democratising tools and education. No matter your social or professional status, we welcome everybody to develop their skills and use the Octanis ecosystem. By keeping costs as low as possible, we remove a significant hurdle for everyone.</li>

			Even a contribution of $50 is enough for a member to build a first prototype!
