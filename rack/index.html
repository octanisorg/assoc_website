			Our goal is to make prototyping tools less intimidating and more accessible to everyone.
			Octanis Racks are the ideal platform for tools and prototyping devices, allowing fully automated access control to tools.
			One rack contains up to eight computer controlled and lockable compartments.
			Foldout tables offer a convenient work surface.
