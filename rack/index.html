		<p>
			Our goal is to make prototyping tools less intimidating and more accessible to everyone.
			Octanis Racks are the ideal platform for tools and prototyping devices, allowing fully automated access control to tools.
			One rack contains up to eight computer controlled (RFID) and lockable compartments.
			Foldout tables offer a convenient work surface.

		<p>You have access to one, you have access to all. Access to tools in the rack is managed by an onboard computer connected to the Octanis rack management system.
		For tools not requiring prior instruction, booking is simple: Select the tool and specify how long you'll use it for. That's it!
