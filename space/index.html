		<p>
			Octanis Microverse is a safe and independent space, in which projects can progress and chaos is permitted. Residents can mingle, play, fail, succeed, learn from others, and advance their projects in an open environment which is detached from their “day job”. Small projects can be stored in project boxes for free while larger set-ups require renting a project bench (see below).
		</br></br>
			A selection of advanced prototyping tools are available as self-service*:

			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.fabcreator.com/">FabCreator CO2 Laser Cutter</a></li>
				<li>Openbuilds CNC</li>
				<li>3D Printers</li>
				<li>Wood and Metal Workbench</li>
				<li>Soldering Station</li>
				<li>PCB Reflow Oven</li>
				<li>PCB Pick & Place Machine</li>
				<li>Scanning Electron Microscope</li>
			</ul>

			* Use of advanced tools like laser cutter or CNC is subject to special conditions (security training, hourly fee).

		<h3 class="subtitle">For projects that grew bigger than a shoebox</h3>
		<p>
			When we started Octanis 1, <a href="/rover">the rover that went to Antarctica</a>, we learned first-hand how important it is to have a dedicated work bench for ambitious long-term projects. But what made the biggest difference, what really accelerated the development x10, was the fact that we built this rover in a shared space embedded in a creative community. Apart from inspiration, it gave us visibility and the necessary pressure to move forward and never stand still! And we met brilliant people along the way who helped us tremendously within their own field of experience.</br></br>

			We also know that most co-working spaces are run as a business and quickly become un-affordable to makers, students, or someone trying to bootstrap their start-up. This is why we are renting out these project benches at an absolute minimum price while still offering everything you need: Your personal work surface and storage shelf, free WIFI, shared coffee machine and cooking facilities as well as access to all tools at Microverse.</br></br>

			Workshops and other events are regularly hosted at Microverse, most prominently the Makers Night every Tuesday allowing you to engage with a broader audience. You may also host your own events which we will gladly help you promote!
